== Introduction==

===Abstract===

This document describes terminology for referring to scripts, transaction parts, and serialization artifacts in the context of transactions.

===Copyright===

This document is licensed under the 3-clause BSD license.

===Motivation===

In the past decade, in many discussions about building transactions, leveraging new output types, and explaining the inner workings of inputs, we noticed that terminology to refer to the components of transactions and functions that scripts fulfill in transactions includes a broad spectrum of competing jargon.
In this document, we describe a set of terms that can be used to refer to transaction components by their function or their context.
The terms are not entirely consistent in themselves since many are already firmly established.
Instead of striving for consistency, we try to relate terms to each other, explore the origins of terms, and fill in the blanks.
The hope is that this terminology could be used in technical writing about Bitcoin as well as future BIPs.

===Objects and their Serialization===

We treat the objects of the Bitcoin protocol (e.g. transactions, blocks) as distinct from their serialization.
We distinguish concrete properties of transactions such as fields and scripts (labeled [Component]) from serialization artifacts (labeled [Artifact]).
For example, version and lock time are fields that can be set during transaction creation and therefore components of a transaction, while the input counter is a serialization artifact resulting from how the input list of the transaction is represented in the transfer format.
Likewise, the input script is a transaction component, but the length indicator of the input script is a serialization artifact.

We also introduce some umbrella terms, concepts, and ideas that are useful to describe aspects of transactions (labeled [Concept]).

===Anatomy of a serialized transaction===

In this section we dissect a serialized transaction. Each sub-level in the list repeats a subset of the transaction’s serialization to label the included parts. The goal is to provide a map from a serialized transaction back to our definitions above. We use the first ever P2TR transaction with a keypath and a scriptpath input <code>37777defed8717c581b4c0509329550e344bdc14ac38f71fc050096887e535c8</code>.

===Definition of Terms===

; annex
: [Component] A witness item reserved for future extensions, currently unused (see [[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki#cite_note-5|BIP341]]).

; amount
: [Component] The count of satoshis assigned to an output.

; bare output script
: [Component] A condition script that is directly defined in the output script field. Used to specify all types of bare outputs including Pay to Pubkey (P2PK), Pay to Public Key Hash (Pay to Public Key Hash), Pay to Multisig (P2MS) outputs, and arbitrary scripts.

; condition script
: [Concept] Umbrella term for scripts that encode the actual spending conditions that must be fulfilled to spend a TXO. Condition scripts may be preceded by one or more forwarding scripts. An output script can either directly contain a condition script in the case of a bare output, or will commit to one or multiple condition scripts for other output types. For P2TR the taproot output key is considered a condition script as well as each leaf script in the script tree. At the time of writing, there are four distinct condition scripts: witness script, leaf script, redeem script (only non-segwit P2SH), and bare output script (P2PK, P2PKH, P2MS, and arbitrary scripts).

; control block
: [Component] The proof of existence for a leaf script. Appears as a witness item in witness stacks for P2TR scriptpath inputs. Only consists of the taproot internal key for script trees with a single leaf script, otherwise provides the taproot internal key as well as a taproot branch in the form of the hashing partners for the used leaf script.

; flag
: [Artifact] A serialization artifact indicating features used by the transaction. As of writing, the only allowed value is <code>01</code> which indicates that the transaction serialization has a witness structure (see [[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0144.mediawiki|BIP144]]).

; forwarding script
: [Concept] A collective term for scripts that redirect input validation to another script or data structure. Witness programs and P2SH Programs are forwarding scripts. Forwarding scripts make use of script templates that imply additional evaluation steps beyond the explicitly expressed conditions. In the case of P2SH, the output script in verbatim only implies that the redeem script must be the preimage of the hash in the output script, but the template prescribes that the redeem script must additionally be satisfied. For witness programs, the output script is even less verbose with more implied meaning.

; input counter
: [Artifact] The length of the transaction input list, aka <code>txin_count</code> (see [[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0144.mediawiki|BIP144]]).

; input index
: [Concept] The position of an input in a transaction’s input list.

; input script
: [Component] aka <code>scriptSig</code>. The Bitcoin code base used Hungarian notation when it was published. This transaction field appearing in transaction inputs was named for containing the signature and being of the type script. Today, this field is better understood as the input script which is used to satisfy spending conditions for non-segwit outputs, redirects validation to the witness stack for wrapped segwit outputs, and is empty for native segwit outputs. The input script may contain an actual script when spending a bare output script, but may only contain push operations for any output type since P2SH.

; leaf script
: [Component] A condition script used for spending P2TR outputs via the scriptpath. The leaf script appears as a witness item.

; leaf version
: [Component] The version of Script used in a leaf script. At the time of writing, only Tapscript is defined.

; lock time
: [Component] aka “nLockTime”. Part of the transaction header. Lock time specifies a time (in blockheight or UNIX time) before which a transaction cannot be included in a block if any input’s sequence number indicates non-finality. The lock time can also indicate a relative spending lock in combination with <code>OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY</code>. Serialized as the four-byte <code>nLockTime</code> integer field.

; marker
: [Artifact] 1-byte serialization artifact indicating that a type of extended serialization is being used for this transaction. Must always be <code>00</code> (see [[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0144.mediawiki|BIP144]]). (Note: Non-segwit nodes will only accept stripped segwit transactions, because the marker appears at the position where non-segwit nodes expect the input counter. The input counter may not be zero, so a complete (non-stripped) segwit transaction appears invalid to a non-segwit node.)

; outpoint
: [Component] Identifies the transaction output (TXO) being spent by a transaction input. Consists of a txid and output index. The txid is serialized in little-endian but displayed in big-endian.

; output counter
: [Artifact] The length of the transaction output list, aka <code>txout_count</code> (see [[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0144.mediawiki|BIP144]]).

; output index
: [Component] Part of an outpoint. The position of the output in a transaction’s output list that created the identified TXO.

; output script
: [Component] aka <code>scriptPubKey</code>. Must be present in each transaction output. Contains either a condition script or a forwarding script. Originally, the Bitcoin code base used Hungarian notation. This field was presumably named <code>scriptPubKey</code> to refer to the transaction field of the type script that contained the public key. The use of this field had evolved beyond that interpretation even when Bitcoin was published since the field could already contain more complicated scripts. Today, this field is referred to as the output script.

; P2SH program
: [Concept] A script template that forwards input validation to the redeem script. P2SH programs are a type of forwarding script.

; redeem script
: [Component] The condition script used in spending P2SH outputs. Is provided in the input script along with script arguments to satisfy it. The input script of wrapped segwit inputs is not a redeem script but a witness program.

; script arguments
: [Concept] Arguments presented to satisfy a condition script, e.g. signatures and public keys.

; script tree
: [Concept] The Merkle tree composed from the collection of leaf scripts committed to by a P2TR output.

; <code>scriptPubKey</code>
: See '''output script'''.

; <code>scriptSig</code>
: See '''input script'''.

; sequence
: [Component] The sequence number appearing in each transaction input. Serialized as the four-byte <code>nSequence</code> integer field. If any input’s sequence number is less than the maximum allowed value, a transaction is non-final.

; signature
: [Component] A script argument that proves a key owner’s consent to a transaction. Composed of an r-value, an s-value, and a sighash flag. ECDSA and Schnorr signatures use different serialization schemes for signatures. The length indicator preceding the signature is a serialization artifact that is not part of the signature. If the default signature hash type <code>SIGHASH_ALL</code> is used, the sighash flag may be omitted for Schnorr signatures.

; sighash flag
: [Component] Part of the signature. A one-byte field that indicates which parts of the transaction a signature commits to.

; taproot branch
: [Component] Part of a control block that specifies the hashing partners necessary to prove the existence of a leaf script in a script tree.

; taproot internal key
: [Component] aka inner key. The untweaked public key before it is tweaked with the Merkle root of the script tree to create the taproot output key. Appears as part of a control block for a scriptpath P2TR input.

; taproot output key
: [Component] The public key present in the witness program of a P2TR output script composed by tweaking the inner key with the script tree’s Merkle root.

; Tapscript
: [Concept] The variant of the Script language used in P2TR leaf scripts (see [[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki|BIP342]]).

; transaction header
: [Concept] Collective term for the serialization artifacts and transaction fields that appear only once in the transaction serialization regardless of lengths of the input and output Lists: transaction version, marker (segwit only), flag (segwit only), input counter, output counter, and lock time.

; transaction input
: [Component] aka input. An element of the transaction input list that consists of an outpoint, an input script, and a sequence. The outpoint identifies the TXO that is being spent. The input script can have various content depending on the type of output being spent. The input script has length 0 for native segwit inputs. In segwit transactions, every input must be accompanied by a witness stack. The witness stack is not part of the transaction input.

; transaction input list
: [Concept] The enumeration of all transaction inputs of a transaction.

; transaction output (TXO)
: [Component] aka <code>txout</code>. A transaction component that consists of an amount and an output script. Adds a new unspent transaction output (UTXO) to the UTXO set that is uniquely identified by an outpoint.

; transaction output list
: [Concept] The enumeration of all transaction outputs of a transaction.

; txid
: [Component] Part of an Outpoint that identifies the transaction that created a TXO. Result of hashing a transaction without its witness structure. The txid is serialized in little-endian but displayed in big-endian.

; unspent transaction output (UTXO)
: [Concept] aka coin. An entry in Bitcoin’s ledger of spendable funds, the UTXO set. UTXOs get created by transaction outputs and spent by transaction inputs. UTXOs are uniquely identified<ref>There have been two instances in which UTXOs with existing outpoints were recreated, see [[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0030.mediawiki|BIP30]]</ref> by an outpoint. The UTXO model with its uniquely-identifiable discrete portions of funds is instrumental to Bitcoin’s solution of the doublespend problem.

; version
: [Component] Part of the transaction header that specifies the transaction version. Serializes as the four-byte <code>nVersion</code> integer field.

; witness item
: [Component] aka witness stack element. An element of a witness stack. Witness items are: witness script (P2WSH only), script arguments, leaf script (P2TR scriptpath only), control block (P2TR scriptpath only), annex (P2TR only). [[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki|BIP341]] also refers to witness items as witness elements or witness stack elements.

; witness program
: [Concept] A script template that forwards input validation to the witness stack. Witness programs are a type of forwarding script. Witness programs appear in the output script for native segwit outputs and in the input script for wrapped segwit inputs.

; witness structure
: [Concept] The part of the serialized transaction that contains the witness stacks for each input.

; witness script
: [Component] A witness item that provides the condition script used to spend P2WSH outputs. Appears in the witness stack.

; witness stack
: [Component] The pre-built stack of witness items that is executed in validation to satisfy an input’s condition script. If a transaction has at least one segwit input, each input has exactly one witness stack. Witness stacks are not scripts, but may include witness items that are scripts. While there is a witness stack for each input, the witness stack is not part of the input. Strictly speaking, a witness stack can contain witness items that will not be added to the stack, such as the control block. The witness stack may contain condition scripts, specifically it will contain a witness script for P2WSH inputs, and a leaf script for a P2TR scriptpath spend.

; witness version
: [Component] The version of a witness program.

; wtxid
: [Concept] aka witness transaction identifier. Result of hashing a complete transaction including its witness structure. Used in transaction propagation and to construct a witness commitment.

<sub>¹ Bare outputs include P2PK, P2PKH, P2MS, and any other arbitrary scripts that are fully defined in the output script.</sub>

==Rationale==

; Amount vs Value
: Amount underscores that we are referring to a count of satoshis rather than subjective value. As Bitcoin transactions (and code altogether) are littered with “values”, we prefer “amount” as being less ambiguous.

; Witness
: Ambiguous, use Witness Stack to refer to the witness data of a single Transaction Input, use Witness Structure when talking about all witness data of a transaction

; Forwarding Scripts and Condition Scripts
: We introduce these two new terms to distinguish two types of functions for “scripts”. The condition scripts encode the actual spending conditions, while forwarding scripts commit the spender to providing another script down the line. [[File:bip-tx-terminology/scripts.png|framed|center|alt=An overview of forwarding and condition scripts|Figure 1]]

; Bare Output Scripts
: Include P2PK, P2PKH, P2MS, and arbitrary other condition scripts directly defined in the output script.

; Flag
: While the Flag currently only indicates the presence of a Witness Structure, it could perhaps also indicate the presence of other extended serialization formats in the future, therefore, it’s only flag, not “witness flag”.

; P2SH Program
: We introduce the term P2SH Program to refer to the commitment in an Output Script that forwards execution to the input script corresponding to witness programs.

; Witness Item vs Witness Element
: BIP341 refers to parts of the witness stack as “witness elements” and “witness stack elements”, but BIP144 speaks of “item count”. We prefer witness item to refer to parts of a witness stack.

; Witness Section vs Witness Structure
: While witness section and witness structure are both used, we prefer the use of witness structure as introduced in BIP144.

; Witness Stack
: While BIP144 refers to witness stacks as “script witnesses”, they are not scripts. Strictly speaking, they’re also not stacks, because some witness items that appear in witness stacks are not added to the stack, such as control blocks. We prefer witness stack as it is well-established.

; Locking Script and Unlocking Script
: Some popular works refer to <code>scriptPubKey</code> and <code>scriptSig</code> as “locking script” and “unlocking script” respectively. We do not recommend the use of these terms since they conflate the transaction component with the function these scripts had for some of the earlier output types. We introduce a set of new terms to decouple the position of the '''output script''' and '''input script''' from the function of locking and unlocking, and to underscore the evolution of output types from executable scripts to templates with additional implied meaning.—As output types have evolved over the years, we have departed from them relying on fully specified executable scripts, but rather imbued certain templates with additional constraints. For example a P2SH program literally interpreted only checks that the redeem script revealed in the input script matches the pre-image in the output script, but the implied meaning of the P2SH program additionally requires the redeem script to be evaluated satisfactorily. Later with wrapped P2WSH, we didn’t even require the witness script to contain all the arguments with push operations directly in a script but rather provide them as separate items akin to a pre-built stack. We refer to these stand-alone witness items to as '''script arguments'''. With native segwit outputs finally, the input script is empty altogether, and no longer plays any role in “unlocking” the funds at all.

; Locking Script vs Output Script + Forwarding Script + Condition Script
: The <code>scriptPubKey</code> has also sometimes been referred to as “locking script”, especially before the activation of the segwit soft fork. However, this term is ambiguous in that it refers to the function of the output script but appears as the label for the field at the same time. This document introduces new terms to distinguish the transaction component from the abstract function it takes. We use '''output script''' when we refer to the <code>scriptPubKey</code> field in the transaction, and speak of either a '''condition script''' or '''forwarding script''' when we refer to the function the output script fulfills in a particular output.
