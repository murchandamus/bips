## Abstract

A Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) provides a concise, self-contained technical description of one new concept,
feature, standard, or incident relevant to the Bitcoin community.

TODO: Should incidents continue to be in-scope?

We intend BIPs to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and
sharing design decisions that have gone into Bitcoin. Each BIP is primarily owned by its author, the BIP Champion, and
represents only the Championâ€™s opinion or recommendation.

This BIP replaces BIP-2 with a more well-defined and clear process.
